The objective of this project is to create a simple calculator using Java.It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

### Key Activities
-**Setting Up the GUI Components**: Elements such as frame, textfield, buttons
-**Initializing Components and Layout**: Font and panel setting
-**Handling User Input and Operations**: Implementation of buttons
-**Arithmetic Operations**: Main functioning of the Calculator and Error Handling

### Key Insights
-**Integration of Swing**: Demonstrates how to use Swing components (JFrame, JTextField, JButton, JPanel) to build a functional GUI application in Java.
-**Event-Driven Programming**: Utilizes event handling (ActionListener) to respond to user interactions (button clicks).
-**User Interface Design**: Provides a simple yet effective layout (GridLayout) for organizing calculator buttons.
-**Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with support for decimal points and basic error handling.
